# AbaqusColorSpectrum
This creates several color gradients for Abaqus visualization in the post-processing setup. The colormaps are taken from Matplotlib. You can use these to display stress, strain, displacement, etc.

In abaqus, once a odb file is opened, click file->scipt and navigate to this script and execute it.
